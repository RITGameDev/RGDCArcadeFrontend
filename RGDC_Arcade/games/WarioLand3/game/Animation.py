	"""
	The animation class is very useful to handle sprite-animations.
	It is recommended to create a class that inherits from this one and then 
	change the _custom()-method to add custom behaviour.

	Most methods who aren't getters return self in order to perform actions like
	animation.pause().reset().get_surface()

		sprites: A list of images of the sprite, each image is a frame of the animation.
			The images all have to have the same size.
			See utilities.split_tiled_surface() for an easy way to generate such a list.

			Sprites can't have an alpha-channel, transparent parts must be indicated by the
			color (225, 0, 225)

		sprite_order: Can be three of the following things:
			Amount (int) of frames every sprite is showed. The order of the sprites played will be the order of the
			sprites in the "sprites"-argument.

			OR

			The amount of frames for every sprites (list). The order of the sprites played will be the order of the
			sprites in the "sprites"-argument, but this time, the amount of frames each sprite is showed can be changed
			individually. ([frames_for_image_1, frames_for_image_2...])

			OR

			The order of the sprites and the amount of frames for every sprite (list of tuples). This list can contain
			more elements than there are sprites. The syntax for this list is [(sprite_nr, frame_length),
			(sprite_nr, frame_length)...].
			An animation with three different sprites can be 5 sprites long,
			playing sprite |: 1, 2, 1, 3, 2 :| for 100 frames per sprite for instance would be expressed as follows:
			Animation([surface_1, surface_2, surface_3], [(1, 100), (2, 100), (1, 100), (3, 100), (1, 100)])
